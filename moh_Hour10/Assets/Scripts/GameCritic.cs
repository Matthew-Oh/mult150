Q: Is the game too easy or hard?
A: The game is simultaneously too easy and too hard; it is quite difficult to intentionally get a ball into a goal, yet the ball can go into the goal by pure chance.

Q: What would make it easier or harder?
A: Maybe if the balls were slower, the player could put more time and thought into directing the balls, allowing them to more easily score goals and reducing the chance to randomly score by chance over time, thus making the player's interactions more meaningful.

Q: What would give it a “wow” factor?
A: Though potentially undermining the gameplay aspects, being able to visualize how incoming balls bounce off the player might be cool. 

Q: What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
A: Being able to make an intenentional goal is cool, but it is tedious having to wait for the balls to come into the right position to do so.
