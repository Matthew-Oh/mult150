Questions
1. The game feels too easy. The obstacles are quite easy to avoid because of their small size and lots of time to react due to the speed.
2. Make the obstacles faster or larger or more in quantity.
3. Make the animation smooth when transitioning in and out of the slowdown and differnet kind of obstacles
4. Getting powerups and highscores are fun.
5. Being unable to get a powerup because it spawns too far away and the repetititveness of the game are tedious.
